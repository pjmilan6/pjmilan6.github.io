ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

I'm a principal AI engineer at [SambaNova Systems](https://sambanova.ai/), where I work closely with customers to build full-stack LLM solutions, focusing on prompt engineering, RAG, fine-tuning, and AI agents. These solutions leverage open-source models like LLaMA, DeepSeek, and E5-Large, all deployed on SambaNovaâ€™s latest AI chip, the SN40L.

My expertise spans **Generative AI**, **Enterprise AI**, and **AI for Science**, which I apply across a wide range of domains. 

I earned a PhD in Aerospace Engineering and an MS in Computational Science and Engineering from the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) in 2021, where I applied deep learning to accelerate simulations of fluid flow and combustion in rocket engines. I also completed two research internships at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov), where I worked on AI-based surrogate models for diesel engines. In 2023, I was selected as one of 81 outstanding early-career engineers nationwide to attend the prestigious U.S. Frontiers of Engineering symposium, organized by the [National Academy of Engineering](https://www.nae.edu/).
